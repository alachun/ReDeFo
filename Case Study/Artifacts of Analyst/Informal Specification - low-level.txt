low-level specifications for RDSM mode

Preconditions (Input Requirements)
The angular velocities in all three axes must be within the range of ¨C360 to 360 degrees per second.

Both the stability duration and the submode runtime must be within a reasonable range of 0 to 10,000.

The current mode must be the Rate Damping Mode (RDSM).

Function Behavior Description
This function modifies three variables:

the current mode,

the submode runtime, and

the angular velocity stability duration.

The return value of the function is either 0 or 1, indicating whether a mode transition has occurred.

Behavior Guarantees (Output Properties)
If the angular velocities in all three directions are within ¡À0.15 degrees per second,
¡ú then the stability duration is incremented by one.

Otherwise, the stability duration remains unchanged (it is not reset to 0).

If any of the following conditions is met:

The system has remained stable for more than 44 seconds and the angular velocities are still within ¡À0.15¡ã/s,

OR the submode has been running for 128 seconds,
¡ú then the mode will transition to Passive Attitude Stabilization Mode (PASM).

Once the mode transitions to PASM, both the submode runtime and the stability duration are reset to zero.

If none of the transition conditions is met, the system remains in RDSM, and the submode runtime is unchanged (neither incremented nor reset).





low-level specifications for PASM mode


Preconditions (Input Requirements)
The solar pitch angle must be within the range of ¨C180 to 180 degrees.

The solar visibility flag must be either 0 or 1.

Both the stability duration and the submode runtime must be within a reasonable range of 0 to 10,000.

The current mode must be the Pitch Axis Search Mode (PASM).

Function Behavior Description
This function modifies the following three variables:

the current mode,

the submode runtime, and

the solar pitch angle stability duration.

The return value of the function is either 0 or 1, indicating whether a mode transition has occurred.

Behavior Guarantees (Output Properties)
If the sun is not visible, the stability duration is reset to 0.

Otherwise, if the solar pitch angle exceeds ¡À0.25 degrees, the stability duration is incremented by one.

If the stability duration has already exceeded 12 seconds, the system transitions to the Cruise Mode, and both the submode runtime and stability duration are reset to zero.

If the submode runtime exceeds 720 seconds, the system transitions to the Roll Axis Search Mode (RASM).

If none of the transition conditions is met, the system remains in PASM, and both the stability duration and submode runtime remain unchanged (neither incremented nor reset).




low-level specifications for RASM mode

Preconditions (Input Requirements)
The solar roll angle must be within the range of ¨C180 to 180 degrees.

The solar visibility flag must be either 0 or 1.

Both the stability duration and the submode runtime must be within a reasonable range of 0 to 10,000.

The current mode must be the Roll Axis Search Mode (RASM).

Function Behavior Description
This function modifies the following three variables:

the current mode,

the submode runtime, and

the solar roll angle stability duration.

The function returns either 0 or 1, indicating whether a mode transition has occurred.

Behavior Guarantees (Output Properties)
If the sun is not visible, the stability duration is reset to 0.

Otherwise, if the solar roll angle exceeds ¡À0.1 degrees, the stability duration is incremented by one.

If the stability duration has already exceeded 12 seconds, the system transitions to Cruise Mode, and both the submode runtime and stability duration are reset to zero.

If the submode runtime exceeds 800 seconds, the system transitions to the Pitch Axis Search Mode (PASM).

If none of the transition conditions is met, the system remains in RASM, and both the stability duration and submode runtime remain unchanged (neither incremented nor reset).
